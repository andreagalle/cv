# My CV in LaTeX

Hi there! I'm an aerospace engineer, and I love programming — that’s why I decided to write my CV in LaTeX! Another reason is that, with a PhD under my belt, I know LaTeX well and genuinely appreciate its precision and flexibility. I’m also passionate about automation, deployment, and containerization, which led me to set up this project in a `devcontainer`. My CV is automatically built with every push/merge into the master branch and deployed as a GitHub page.

You can download both versions of my CV below:

- [Detailed CV](./long.pdf) (Extended Version)
- [One-Pager](./short.pdf) (Short Version)
I hope you enjoy reading my CV project. Happy coding!
