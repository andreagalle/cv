# My CV in LaTeX - Andrea Gallegati

Hi there! I'm an aerospace engineer, and I love programming — that’s why I decided to write my CV in LaTeX! Another reason is that, with a PhD under my belt, I know LaTeX well and genuinely appreciate its precision and flexibility. 

I’m also passionate about automation, deployment, and containerization, which led me to set up this project in a `devcontainer`. My CV is automatically built with every push/merge into the master branch and deployed as a GitHub page.

You can download any version of it, here below:

- [Detailed CV](./long.pdf) (Extended Version)
- [One-Pager](./short.pdf) (Short Version)

I did it in my spare time. I even asked a generative AI to rephrase most of it. So if you're wondering - whether or not - to scrape it with another AI, I'm fine with it.

I hope you enjoy reading about me. Happy coding!
